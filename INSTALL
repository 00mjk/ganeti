Installation of the software
============================

Before installing, please verify that you have the following programs:
  - lvm 2
  - ssh
  - drbd (kernel module and userspace utils)
  - fping
  - python twisted library (the core is enough)
  - python openssl bindings

To install, simply do ./configure && make && make install

This will install the software under /usr/local. You then need to copy
ganeti.init to /etc/init.d and integrate it into your boot sequence
(``chkconfig``, ``update-rc.d``, etc.).

Cluster initialisation
======================

Before initialising the cluster, on each node you need to create the following
directories:

  - /etc/ganeti
  - /var/log/ganeti
  - /var/lib/ganeti
  - /srv/ganeti and /srv/ganeti/os

After this, use ``gnt-cluster init``.
