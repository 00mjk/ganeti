    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Ganeti is a virtualization cluster management software. You are
      expected to be a system administrator familiar with your Linux
      distribution and the Xen or KVM virtualization environments
      before using it.
    </para>

    <para>
      The various components of Ganeti all have man pages and
      interactive help. This manual though will help you getting
      familiar with the system by explaining the most common
      operations, grouped by related use.
    </para>

    <para>
      After a terminology glossary and a section on the prerequisites
      needed to use this manual, the rest of this document is divided
      in three main sections, which group different features of
      Ganeti:

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>
        You need to have your Ganeti cluster installed and configured before
        you try any of the commands in this document. Please follow the
        <emphasis>Ganeti installation tutorial</emphasis> for instructions on
        how to do that.

    <title>Managing Instances</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Adding/Removing an instance</title>

      <para>
        Adding a new virtual instance to your Ganeti cluster is really easy.
        The command is:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance add -n <replaceable>TARGET_NODE<optional>:SECONDARY_NODE</optional></replaceable> -o <replaceable>OS_TYPE</replaceable> -t <replaceable>DISK_TEMPLATE</replaceable> <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        The instance name must be resolvable (e.g. exist in DNS) and
        usually to an address in the same subnet as the cluster
        itself. Options you can give to this command include:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>The disk size (<option>-s</option>) for a
            single-disk instance, or multiple <option>--disk
            <replaceable>N</replaceable>:size=<replaceable>SIZE</replaceable></option>
            options for multi-instance disks</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>The memory size (<option>-B memory</option>)</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>The number of virtual CPUs (<option>-B vcpus</option>)</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
              Arguments for the NICs of the instance; by default, a
              single-NIC instance is created. The IP and/or bridge of
              the NIC can be changed via <option>--nic
              0:ip=<replaceable>IP</replaceable>,bridge=<replaceable>BRIDGE</replaceable></option>
            </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>There are four types of disk template you can choose from:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>diskless</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The instance has no disks. Only used for special purpouse
              operating systems or for testing.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>file</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The instance will use plain files as backend for its
            disks.  No redundancy is provided, and this is somewhat
            more difficult to configure for high performance.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>plain</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The instance will use LVM devices as backend for its disks.
              No redundancy is provided.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>drbd</term>
          <listitem>
            <simpara><emphasis role="strong">Note:</emphasis> This is only
              valid for multi-node clusters using drbd 8.0.x</simpara>
            <simpara>
              A mirror is set between the local node and a remote one, which
              must be specified with the second value of the --node option. Use
              this option to obtain a highly available instance that can be
              failed over to a remote node should the primary one fail.
            </simpara>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

      </variablelist>

      <para>
        For example if you want to create an highly available instance use the
        drbd disk templates:
        <synopsis>gnt-instance add -n <replaceable>TARGET_NODE</replaceable><optional>:<replaceable>SECONDARY_NODE</replaceable></optional> -o <replaceable>OS_TYPE</replaceable> -t drbd \
  <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

      <para>
        To know which operating systems your cluster supports you can use
        <synopsis>gnt-os list</synopsis>
      </para>

      <para>
        Removing an instance is even easier than creating one. This
        operation is irrereversible and destroys all the contents of
        your instance. Use with care:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance remove <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Starting/Stopping an instance</title>

      <para>
        Instances are automatically started at instance creation time. To
        manually start one which is currently stopped you can run:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance startup <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        While the command to stop one is:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance shutdown <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        The command to see all the instances configured and their status is:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance list</synopsis>

      </para>

      <para>
        Do not use the xen commands to stop instances. If you run for
        example xm shutdown or xm destroy on an instance Ganeti will
        automatically restart it (via the
        <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ganeti-watcher</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>)
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Exporting/Importing an instance</title>

      <para>
        You can create a snapshot of an instance disk and Ganeti
        configuration, which then you can backup, or import into
        another cluster. The way to export an instance is:

        <synopsis>gnt-backup export -n <replaceable>TARGET_NODE</replaceable> <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        The target node can be any node in the cluster with enough
        space under <filename class="directory">/srv/ganeti</filename>
        to hold the instance image. Use the
        <option>--noshutdown</option> option to snapshot an instance
        without rebooting it. Any previous snapshot of the same
        instance existing cluster-wide under <filename
        class="directory">/srv/ganeti</filename> will be removed by
        this operation: if you want to keep them move them out of the
        Ganeti exports directory.
      </para>

      <para>
        Importing an instance is similar to creating a new one. The command is:

        <synopsis>gnt-backup import -n <replaceable>TARGET_NODE</replaceable> -t <replaceable>DISK_TEMPLATE</replaceable> --src-node=<replaceable>NODE</replaceable> --src-dir=DIR INSTANCE_NAME</synopsis>

        Most of the options available for the command
        <emphasis>gnt-instance add</emphasis> are supported here too.

      <title>Failing over an instance</title>

      <para>
        If an instance is built in highly available mode you can at
        any time fail it over to its secondary node, even if the
        primary has somehow failed and it's not up anymore. Doing it
        is really easy, on the master node you can just run:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance failover <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        That's it. After the command completes the secondary node is
        now the primary, and vice versa.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Live migrating an instance</title>

      <para>
        If an instance is built in highly available mode, it currently
        runs and both its nodes are running fine, you can at migrate
        it over to its secondary node, without dowtime. On the master
        node you need to run:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance migrate <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

      </para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2>
      <title>Replacing an instance disks</title>

      <para>
        So what if instead the secondary node for an instance has
        failed, or you plan to remove a node from your cluster, and
        you failed over all its instances, but it's still secondary
        for some? The solution here is to replace the instance disks,
        changing the secondary node:
        <synopsis>gnt-instance replace-disks <option>-n <replaceable>NODE</replaceable></option> <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        This process is a bit long, but involves no instance
        downtime, and at the end of it the instance has changed its
        secondary node, to which it can if necessary be failed over.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Failing over the master node</title>

      <para>
        This is all good as long as the Ganeti Master Node is
        up. Should it go down, or should you wish to decommission it,
        just run on any other node the command:

        <synopsis>gnt-cluster masterfailover</synopsis>

        and the node you ran it on is now the new master.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Adding/Removing nodes</title>

      <para>
        And of course, now that you know how to move instances around,
        it's easy to free up a node, and then you can remove it from
        the cluster:

        <synopsis>gnt-node remove <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        and maybe add a new one:

        <synopsis>gnt-node add <optional><option>--secondary-ip=<replaceable>ADDRESS</replaceable></option></optional> <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable>

      </synopsis>
      </para>

    <title>Debugging Features</title>

    <para>
      At some point you might need to do some debugging operations on
      your cluster or on your instances. This section will help you
      with the most used debugging functionalities.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Accessing an instance's disks</title>

      <para>
        From an instance's primary node you have access to its
        disks. Never ever mount the underlying logical volume manually
        on a fault tolerant instance, or you risk breaking
        replication. The correct way to access them is to run the
        command:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance activate-disks <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        And then access the device that gets created.  After you've
        finished you can deactivate them with the deactivate-disks
        command, which works in the same way.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Accessing an instance's console</title>

      <para>
        The command to access a running instance's console is:

        <synopsis>gnt-instance console <replaceable>INSTANCE_NAME</replaceable></synopsis>

        Use the console normally and then type
        <userinput>^]</userinput> when done, to exit.
      </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Instance OS definitions Debugging</title>

      <para>
        Should you have any problems with operating systems support
        the command to ran to see a complete status for all your nodes
        is:

        <synopsis>gnt-os diagnose</synopsis>

      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Cluster-wide debugging</title>

      <para>
        The gnt-cluster command offers several options to run tests or
        execute cluster-wide operations. For example:

      <screen>
gnt-cluster command
gnt-cluster copyfile
gnt-cluster verify
gnt-cluster verify-disks
gnt-cluster getmaster
gnt-cluster version
      </screen>

        See the man page <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>gnt-cluster</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>8</manvolnum> </citerefentry> to know more about
        their usage.
