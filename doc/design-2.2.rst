Ganeti 2.2 design
=================

This document describes the major changes in Ganeti 2.2 compared to
the 2.1 version.

The 2.2 version will be a relatively small release. Its main aim is to
avoid changing too much of the core code, while addressing issues and
adding new features and improvements over 2.1, in a timely fashion.

Detailed design
===============

As for 2.1 we divide the 2.2 design into three areas:

- core changes, which affect the master daemon/job queue/locking or
  all/most logical units
- logical unit/feature changes
- external interface changes (eg. command line, os api, hooks, ...)
