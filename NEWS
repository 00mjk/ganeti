Version 0.1.1 (Tue, 26 May 2009):
  - Add a new program, “hail”, which is an iallocator plugin and can
    allocate/relocate instances
  - Experimental support for non-mirrored instances (hail supports them,
    hbal should no longer abort when it finds such instances and simply
    ignore them)
  - The RAPI port and/or scheme can be overriden now, and even “file://”
    schemes can be used if the message body has been saved under the
    appropriate name
  - Lots of code reorganization, esp. rewritten loading pipeline
  - Better data checking and better error messages in case validation
    fails; tools now consider nodes with error in input data (‘?’
    returned by ganeti) as offline
  - Small enhancement to the makefile for simpler packaging

Version 0.1.0 (Tue, 19 May 2009):
  - Drop compatibility with Ganeti 1.2
  - Add a new minimum score option (with a very low default), should
    help with very good clusters (but is still not optimal)
  - Add a --quiet option to hbal
  - Add support for reading offline nodes directly from the cluster

Version 0.0.8 (Tue, 21 Apr 2009):
  - hbal: prevent mismatches in wrong node names being passed to -O, by
    aborting in this case
  - add the ability to write the commands (-C) to a script via
    (-C<file>), so that it can be later executed directly; this has also
    changed the commands to include the ncessary -f flags to skip
    confirmations
  - add checks for extra argument in hbal and hn1, so that unintended
    errors are catched
  - raise the accepted “missing” memory limit to 512MB, to cover usual
    Xen reservations

Version 0.0.7 (Mon, 23 Mar 2009):
  - added support for offline nodes, which are not used as targets for
    instance relocation and if they hold instances the hbal algorithm
    will attempt to relocate these away
  - added support for offline instances, which now will no longer skew
    the free memory estimation of nodes; the algorithm will no longer
    create conditions for N+1 failures when such instances are later
    started
  - implemented a complete model of node resources, in order to
    prevent an unintended re-occurrence of cases like the offline
    instance were we miscalculate some node resource; this gives warning
    now in case the node reported free disk or free memory deviates by
    more than a set amount from the expected value
  - a new tool *hscan* that can generate the input text-file for the
    other tools by collection via RAPI
  - some small changes to the build system to make it more friendly;
    also included the generated documentation in the source archive

Version 0.0.6 (Mon, 16 Mar 2009):
  - re-factored the hbal algorithm to make it stable in the sense that it
    gives the same solution when restarted from the middle; barring
    rounding of disk/memory and incomplete reporting from Ganeti (for
    1.2), it should be now feasible to rely on its output without
    generating moves ad infinitum
  - the hbal algorithm now uses two more variables: the node N+1
    failures and the amount of reserved memory; the first of which tries
    to ‘fix’ the N+1 status, the latter tries to distribute secondaries
    more equally
  - the hbal algorithm now uses two more moves at each step:
    replace+failover and failover+replace (besides the original
    failover, replace, and failover+replace+failover)
  - slightly changed the build system to embed GIT version/tags into the
    binaries so that we know for a binary from which tree it was done,
    either via ‘--version’ or via “strings hbal|grep version”
  - changed the solution list and in general the hbal output to be more
    clear by default, and changed “gnt-instance failover” to
    “gnt-instance migrate”
  - added man pages for the two binaries

Version 0.0.5 (Mon, 09 Mar 2009):
  - a few small improvements for hbal (possibly undone by later
    changes), hbal is now quite faster
  - fix documentation building
  - allow hbal to work on non N+1 compliant clusters, but without
    guarantees that the end cluster will be compliant; in any case, this
    should give a smaller number of nodes that are not compliant if the
    cluster state permits it
  - strip common domain suffix from nodes and instances, so that output
    is shorter and hopefully clearer

Version 0.0.4 (Sun, 15 Feb 2009):
  - better balancing algorithm in hbal
  - implemented an RAPI collector, now the cluster data can be gathered
    automatically via RAPI and doesn't need manual export of node and
    instance list

Version 0.0.3 (Wed, 28 Jan 2009):
  - initial release of the hbal, a cluster rebalancing tool
  - input data format changed due to hbal requirements

Version 0.0.2 (Tue, 06 Jan 2009):
  - fix handling of some common cases (cluster N+1 compliant from the
    start, too big depth given, failure to compute solution)
  - add option to print the needed command list for reaching the
    proposed solution

Version 0.0.1 (Tue, 06 Jan 2009):
  - initial release of hn1 tool
