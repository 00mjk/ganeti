Version 0.0.6 (Mon, 16 Mar 2009):
  - refactored the hbal algorithm to make it stable in the sense that it
    gives the same solution when restarted from the middle; barring
    rouding of disk/memory and incomplete reporting from Ganeti (for
    1.2), it should be now feasible to rely on its output without
    generating moves ad infinitum
  - the hbal algorithm now uses two more variables: the node N+1
    failures and the amount of reserved memory; the first of which tries
    to ‘fix’ the N+1 status, the latter tries to distribute secondaries
    more equally
  - the hbal algorithm now uses two more moves at each step:
    replace+failover and failover+replace (besides the original
    failover, replace, and failover+replace+failover)
  - slightly changed the build system to embed GIT version/tags into the
    binaries so that we know for a binary from which tree it was done,
    either via ‘--version’ or via “strings hbal|grep version”
  - changed the solution list and in general the hbal output to be more
    clear by default, and changed “gnt-instance failover” to
    “gnt-instance migrate”
  - added man pages for the two binaries

Version 0.0.5 (Mon, 09 Mar 2009):
  - a few small improvements for hbal (possibly undone by later
    changes), hbal is now quite faster
  - fix documentation building
  - allow hbal to work on non N+1 compliant clusters, but without
    guarantees that the end cluster will be compliant; in any case, this
    should give a smaller number of nodes that are not compliant if the
    cluster state permits it
  - strip common domain suffix from nodes and instances, so that output
    is shorter and hopefully clearer

Version 0.0.4 (Sun, 15 Feb 2009):
  - better balancing algorithm in hbal
  - implemented an RAPI collector, now the cluster data can be gathered
    automatically via RAPI and doesn't need manual export of node and
    instance list

Version 0.0.3 (Wed, 28 Jan 2009):
  - initial release of the hbal, a cluster rebalancing tool
  - input data format changed due to hbal requirements

Previous version was initial announcement.
