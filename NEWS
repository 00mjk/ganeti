Version 0.0.5:
  - a few small improvements for hbal (possibly undone by later
    changes), hbal is now quite faster
  - fix documentation building
  - allow hbal to work on non N+1 compliant clusters, but without
    guarantees that the end cluster will be compliant; in any case, this
    should give a smaller number of nodes that are not compliant if the
    cluster state permits it
  - strip common domain suffix from nodes and instances, so that output
    is shorter and hopefully clearer

Version 0.0.4:
  - better balancing algorithm in hbal
  - implemented an RAPI collector, now the cluster data can be gathered
    automatically via RAPI and doesn't need manual export of node and
    instance list

Version 0.0.3:
  - initial release of the hbal, a cluster rebalancing tool
  - input data format changed due to hbal requirements

Previous version was initial announcement.
